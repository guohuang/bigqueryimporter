This is exactly what creates violent religion called &quot;state&quot;.<p>My suggestion is to use &quot;contracts&quot; as a basis for all social agreements. People voluntarily agree to certain behaviour between each other and &quot;lock up&quot; themselves in voluntary obligations. Breaking these obligations is punished by economic ostracism by others, who&#x27;d like to keep their obligations and benefits. If you steal, we will not sell you bread until you pay your debts. That simple. If some bunch of people agreed to not pollute the river and you come and pollute, they would not deal with you. If you disagree, no one kidnaps you, please feel free to negotiate and boycott back. Just like on your interview: if you don&#x27;t like job conditions, you withdraw your service. But also employer withdraws his payment if he doesn&#x27;t like your conditions. So you either come to some common grounds (without any need for &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;morality&quot;), or you go different ways.<p>On a large scale it can work beautifully with internet and crypto proofs of agreements. You can have millions of people easily lock up in common agreements on intellectual property, pollution, insurance against disasters etc. Anyone willing to go against existing relations will face ostracism from millions of people absolutely automatically (via dispute resolution organizations that will act as delegates&#x2F;proxies).<p>The trick is only to grow such &quot;contract &#x2F; dispute resolution&quot; network to a large enough scale when bullying is big economic risk. Today, people trust state to make decisions who&#x27;s bad, who&#x27;s good and state makes a good job to hide these people in jail and courts, so you don&#x27;t even have a chance to negotiate openly. Almost no one has millions of chances to find supporters. In voluntary society you can always go to a competing agency and try to convince them that you are right and others are wrong. If they can successfully prove that to customers, they&#x27;ll win the market.

Also, there's too much of this idea floating around that doing everything from the terminal is a badge of honor. It's cool that you can but it doesn't mean you should.

His dissertation provides 3 implementations of forth, just as Dybvig provides 3 for scheme. The two papers are nearly identical in scope; showing different implementation techniques for a tiny kernel language. However, the Forth paper is entirely in C and assembly, without the slightest hint of formal semantics or any other mathematical reasoning. It's a hack upon glorious hack. You can't reason about Forth code without FULL abstract execution, to wit, implementing a full Forth VM with side-effects, or emitting 3-address-code, or some other linear tuple IR, and using traditional techniques from register-based languages with variable assignment.<p>Having said that, I can see why Forth might be fun, as a soul-cleansing language for a programmer who has spent too long in abstraction. Haskellers should use it to bring themselves down a notch [<i>grumble, mumble mumble, something rude, under my breath</i>]<p>[Edit:<p>Oh fuck, I forgot about Factor!<p>I pre-accept defeat, and retract my possibly under-informed arguments if and when Slava shows up to this discussion :-)<p>If his opinion differs, I don't think I am qualified to disagree with the sharpest dude hacking on a language implementation today, and Forth domain expert to boot]","parent":1817493,"deleted":null,"dead":null,"descendants":null,"id":1818116,"ranking":null},{"by":"FreedomAttorney","score":1,"time":1488323872,"timestamp":{"value":"2017-02-28 23:17:52.000"},"title":"WHY DRUG DEALERS Love THE WAR ON DRUGS","type":"story","url":"https://attorneyforfreedom.com/blog/why-drug-dealers-love-the-war-on-drugs","text":"","parent":null,"deleted":null,"dead":true,"descendants":null,"id":13759225,"ranking":null},{"by":"giovannicarus","score":1,"time":1436554537,"timestamp":{"value":"2015-07-10 18:55:37.000"},"title":"Interface Builder After WWDC and Our Impressions","type":"story","url":"http://www.ckl.io/blog/interface-builder-pros-cons-thoughts/","text":"","parent":null,"deleted":null,"dead":true,"descendants":null,"id":9865992,"ranking":null},{"by":"rmason","score":1,"time":1454441247,"timestamp":{"value":"2016-02-02 19:27:27.000"},"title":"The most funded startup by state","type":"story","url":"http://tech.co/most-funded-startup-by-state-2016-02","text":"","parent":null,"deleted":null,"dead":true,"descendants":null,"id":11021793,"ranking":null},{"by":"unsettle","score":1,"time":1416506635,"timestamp":{"value":"2014-11-20 18:03:55.000"},"title":"How I Quadrupled My Income and Started Living the Life I Wanted","type":"story","url":"http://add-vodka.com/start/","text":"","parent":null,"deleted":null,"dead":true,"descendants":null,"id":8637091,"ranking":null},{"by":"_mikeschwartz","score":1,"time":1443550269,"timestamp":{"value":"2015-09-29 18:11:09.000"},"title":"Box Platform: Powering Content Services in Your Apps","type":"story","url":"https://developers.box.com/box-platform/","text":"","parent":null,"deleted":null,"dead":null,"descendants":0,"id":10298283,"ranking":null},{"by":"nelsontky","score":1,"time":1395660607,"timestamp":{"value":"2014-03-24 11:30:07.000"},"title":"What are the pros and cons of competition between mobile operating systems","type":"story","url":"","text":"So you know I was sitting on the couch and wondering what are the pros and cons of competition between mobile OSes.
